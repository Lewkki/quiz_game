# 🧠 Quiz Game (Python)

A beginner-friendly command-line quiz game built in Python.
This project is designed to grow over time, starting from a simple version and gradually adding more features as I improve my coding skills.

# 📌 Version History

### v1.0

- Hardcoded quiz questions
- Individual input checks per question
- Manual score tracking
- Basic program flow

### v1.1

- Refactored questions into a dictionary
- Loop-based question handling
- Scalable scoring system
- Cleaner, more maintainable code

### v1.2

- Added play / exit prompt
- Improved input validation (`y/yes`, `n/no`)
- Stripped whitespace from user input
- Added question numbering and progress display
- Improved overall game flow and user experience

### v1.3

- Randomized question order each playthrough
- Introduced use of the `random` module
- Improved replay variety without changing core gameplay

# 🧠 What I’ve Learned So Far

- Using dictionaries to store structured data
- Looping through key-value pairs with `.items()`
- Handling user input safely with `.strip()` and `.lower()`
- Writing correct boolean logic in conditionals
- Managing program flow with `while` and `for` loops
- Tracking and resetting state (score, question number)
- Writing scalable code that adapts as data grows
- Incrementally improving a project through versioning
- Importing and using Python standard library modules
- Converting dictionary keys to a list for manipulation
- Shuffling data using `random.shuffle()`
- Separating data storage from data execution flow
- Debugging logical errors in loops and iteration

# 🎯 Goal of This Project

This project is part of a daily coding habit focused on building confidence and foundational Python skills by improving the same project over multiple versions.
