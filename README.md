# 🧠 Quiz Game (Python)

A beginner-friendly command-line quiz game built in Python.
This project is designed to grow over time, starting from a simple version and gradually adding more features as I improve my coding skills.

## 📦 Project Status

This project is currently frozen.

The goal of this project was to practice Python fundamentals, program flow, input validation, and incremental versioning.  
No further features are planned at this time, though it may be revisited in the future for refactoring or expansion.

# 📌 Version History

### v1.0

- Hardcoded quiz questions
- Individual input checks per question
- Manual score tracking
- Basic program flow

### v1.1

- Refactored questions into a dictionary
- Loop-based question handling
- Scalable scoring system
- Cleaner, more maintainable code

### v1.2

- Added play / exit prompt
- Improved input validation (`y/yes`, `n/no`)
- Stripped whitespace from user input
- Added question numbering and progress display
- Improved overall game flow and user experience

### v1.3

- Randomized question order each playthrough
- Introduced use of the `random` module
- Improved replay variety without changing core gameplay

### v1.4

- Added option for the player to choose how many questions to answer
- Implemented input validation for numeric user input
- Limited quiz length using list slicing
- Improved game flow and error handling

# 🧠 What I’ve Learned So Far

- Using dictionaries to store structured data
- Looping through key-value pairs with `.items()`
- Handling user input safely with `.strip()` and `.lower()`
- Writing correct boolean logic in conditionals
- Managing program flow with `while` and `for` loops
- Tracking and resetting state (score, question number)
- Writing scalable code that adapts as data grows
- Incrementally improving a project through versioning
- Importing and using Python standard library modules
- Converting dictionary keys to a list for manipulation
- Shuffling data using `random.shuffle()`
- Separating data storage from data execution flow
- Debugging logical errors in loops and iteration
- Validating user input to prevent runtime errors
- Safely converting user input from strings to integers
- Using `continue` to control loop flow intentionally
- Slicing lists to limit iteration (`list[:n]`)
- Combining multiple condition checks for cleaner logic
- Designing small features without breaking existing functionality
- Debugging logic and control-flow issues in loops

# 🎯 Goal of This Project

This project is part of a daily coding habit focused on building confidence and foundational Python skills by improving the same project over multiple versions.
